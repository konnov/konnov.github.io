I am also writing long technical blog posts with my friends at [Protocols Made
Fun][pmf]. The goal of PMF is to explain specification, testing, and
verification techniques that work in practice. While this website focuses on
service, value, and business, PMF focuses on long-term research, protocols, and
fun.
