It was my pleasure to participate in [VSTTE24][] and give an invited talk there,
mainly about [Apalache][]. Since I had a break in academic conferences, I was
pleasantly surprised by practical focus of this academic conference. Since the
conference was held entirely offline, there are no recordings. However, you can
read my [blogpost][Ben-Or], which I started to write right on the train from
Prague to Vienna.

If you wonder what the talk was about, here is the abstract:

> TLA<sup>+</sup> continues to be the preferred specification language for
fault-tolerant distributed algorithms, especially, for distributed consensus.
Although consensus algorithms have relatively concise specifications,
analyzing their behavior is notoriously difficult due to the inherent control
and data non-determinism arising from their distributed nature and potential
Byzantine faults. In this talk, I will showcase the spectrum of guarantees
that can be obtained in reasonable time using the Apalache model checker. I
will also discuss the usability aspects of both TLA<sup>+</sup> and Apalache
for system engineers.
