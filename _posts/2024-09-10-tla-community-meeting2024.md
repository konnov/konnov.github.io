It was my pleasure to talk about the improvements and practical applications of
[Apalache][]. As always, catching up with [Stephan Merz][] and [Giuliano Losa][]
was insightful!

Since the community meeting was co-located with 26<sup>th</sup> international
[Symposium on Formal Methods][FM24], it was held completely offline. Hence, no
recording is available. You can check [my slides][slides].
