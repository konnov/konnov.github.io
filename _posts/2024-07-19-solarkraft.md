Solarkraft is a runtime monitoring tool for Stellar [Soroban][], powered by
[TLA+][] and [Apalache][]. We have finished the activation phase (call 24) at
[Stellar Community Fund][] and continue with phase 1 (call 29). See the
[Project page][Solarkraft-SCF] at SCF.

> This work continued in phase 1, SCF #29. See more details at the [Solarkraft
page][phase 1] by Thomas Pani.
