title: Research & development as a service
description: >-
  After 20+ years in academic and industrial research, I went independent in 2024.
  I now take on R&D projects as a contractor and secure Web3 grants with
  partners...

[Contact me](#get-in-touch), if you need a custom tool to test, fuzz, simulate
or verify your protocol. Also, if you need someone to understand the math behind
your system or the research that was done in your field. If you need a formal
specification and formal verification that works in practice, I am happy to
help. Finally, if you need a sharp eye on your code, I have experience with
security audits and Web3 contests.

My main approach is to solve hard customer's problems by applying smart tools
and developing custom tooling for solving those problems.  I am not interested
in doing work merely for marketing or to check a box.  However, if you need
support in sharing research findings &mdash; whether through [writing papers][]
or [presenting at conferences][] &mdash; I am always happy to contribute.

Need a DSL or a simulator similar to [Quint][]? Or you need a custom tool to
solve constraints similar to [Apalache][]? Perhaps, you need a custom fuzz
suite?  I can help you with that. You are releasing in two weeks and need more
than one-man show? We can assemble a team of people who can actually work
together without arguing.
