I have a proven track record of submitting **valid** high and medium
findings at [Code4rena][], [Sherlock][], and [Hackerone][], individually,
as well as in a team. In addition to that, I was conducting several Web3
protocol audits while working at [Informal Systems][]. Need a proof? DM.

Given my expertise, I am flexible to help you with a range of activities
along the stack/confidence axes:

**Stack:**

  - Consensus, e.g., Tendermint/CometBFT
  - Interchain communication, e.g, bridges and IBC
  - Smart contracts and dApps, e.g., Solidity, Cosmwasm, Cosmos SDK

**Confidence:**

  - Manual code review
  - Fuzzing, e.g., using Medusa
  - Protocol specification and analysis, e.g., in TLA<sup>+</sup>
  - Model checking, e.g., using TLC and Apalache
  - Math proofs

If you think that your project is too big for one person, or you are short
on time, I am connected to a network of researchers, including my former
peers.
