[SSF-MC][] is a research project supported by the Ethereum Foundation's Ecosystem Support Program.
The goal is to investigate how model checking, especially the model checker [Apalache][], can help
the researchers in verifying consensus algorithms such as Single-Slot Finality.

We have started the project in Q3 of 2024. Stay tuned for more details.
