Quint is an alternative syntax for the logic TLA<sup>+</sup>. When we
started the project at [Informal Systems][] in 2021, we wanted to test the
following hypothesis:

*Would engineers onboard to TLA<sup>+</sup> faster, when they are offered a
syntax that looks more like a programming language?*

In addition to the alternative syntax, Quint offers several features that
are expected by software engineers:

 - a type checker and an effects checker,
 - a VSCode plugin,
 - a testing framework and a randomized simulator.

Quint was developed by [Shon Feder][], [Gabriela Mafra][], [Thomas Pani][],
[Jure Kukovec][], and myself. It is maintained and further extended at
Informal Systems.
