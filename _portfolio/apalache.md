Perhaps, the most concise summary of Apalache can be found on [Leslie
Lamport's page on TLA<sup>+</sup>][]:

> Apalache is an alternative to TLC for checking TLA+ specifications.
> While TLC is an explicit-state model checker, Apalache is a symbolic
> model checker.  It checks safety for bounded executions and inductive
> invariants for unbounded executions, assuming that all data structures
> are finite.  The tool leverages the SMT solver Z3, from Microsoft
> Research.

I started the [research project on Apalache][] at TU Wien in 2016, after
receiving the grant of 539k EUR from [Vienna Science and Technology
Fund][]. In 2018, I continued research on Apalache at [VeriDis][], Inria
Nancy. From 2019 to 2023, I was leading industrial adoption of Apalache at
Interchain Foundation and Informal Systems. Many researchers and engineers
have contributed to Apalache, including: [Thanh Hai Tran][], [Shon
Feder][], [Jure Kukovec][], [Gabriela Mafra][], [Rodrigo Otoni][], [Thomas
Pani][], [Andrey Kupriyanov][], and [Philip Offtermatt][].
